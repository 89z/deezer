## CDN

Note that two CDN are available, but the HTTP one seems to be faster, perhaps
because HTTPS overhead is not used:

- http://e-cdn-proxy-0.deezer.com
- https://e-cdns-proxy-0.dzcdn.net

## SID cookie

After some testing, this cookie seems to expire about three hours from last use.
So if you use it once every three hours, it should stay alive, but I would need
to do more testing to know for sure.
